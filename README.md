# FastFlow based Locality Sensitive Hash Similarity Join framework

We introduce a C++-based high-level parallel pattern implemented on top of FastFlow Building Blocks to provide the programmer with ready-to-use similarity join computations. The SimilarityJoin pattern is implemented according to the MapReduce paradigm enriched with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to optimize the whole computation. The new parallel pattern can be used with any C++ serializable data structure and executed on shared- and distributed-memory machines.
